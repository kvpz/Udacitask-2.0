# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?

    - Terminal-table(1.6.0): I used it to neatly display items. The first
      box in the table is the list's name and below it are sublist types.
    - Colorize(0.8.1): It helps distinguish between item types.
    - Chronic(0.10.2): A natural language date/time parser. I use it in
      TodoItems::initialize because to store the dates in MM/DD/YY format.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.

  a) I implemented TodoItem::prioritize_todo() which orders an array of TodoItems. To make it
  work, I included Comparable in TodoItem and overrode the comparison method.

  b) UdaciList::sort_by_type which sorts the list alphabetically by item types.

  c) UdaciList::delete_by_description(desc) allows deletion by an item's description.

  d) UdaciList::show_prioritized_todo

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
    40 hours

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

    Learning how IO streams work in Ruby. I also learned to stick
    with one idea at a time. Any idea would be a learning experience anyway. DECIDING on
    a feature to implement is the most difficult part for me. It helps to just think
    about what a user of the program would want.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
    1) I added a simple method (empty?) to identify if a list is empty. This
    improves readability and is useful for testing within app.rb (in a readable way).

    2) Created UdaciList::filter(item_type) to print all items of one type. This function
     also implicitly returns an array with those items.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
    UI/UX design.
