# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.

  a) I implemented TodoItem::prioritize_todo() which orders an array of TodoItems. To make it
  work, I included Comparable in TodoItem and overrode the comparison method.

  b)

  c) I added a default argument to UdaciList::all() so that I can reuse
   that function to print the list of a type of item in UdaciList::filter().

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
    30 hours

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

    Learning how IO streams working in Ruby (kind of). Also I've learned to just stick
    with one idea at a time. Any idea would be a learning experience anyway. DECIDING on
    a feature to implement is the most difficult part for me. It helps to just think
    about what a user of the program would want.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?



4. Where do you still have room to grow?

    UI/UX design.
